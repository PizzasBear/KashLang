# Kash
Kash is an interpreted lisp like language written in rust. Kash is intended for scripting.

## Getting Started
Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/PizzasBear/KashLang/releases/), download the interpreter for your platform (macos isn't supported yet). Create a folder with the executable. In that folder create the file `hello.ks` and put the following in it:
```
println "Hello World!"
```
Then on windows open powershell, navigate to the folder and run `.\kash-windows.exe hello.ks`, on linux open POSIX compatible shell, navigate to the folder and run `./kash-linux-gnu hello.ks`.
